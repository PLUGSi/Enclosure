# Enclosure

Since the PLUGSi Consists of main components Base and Moduels and considering modular architecture the following decisions are made

1. Try to make it small as possible
   i. Give it a compact futuristic look
3. All the sides in the Base and Modules are same size Cubic Shape
   i. when we consider about connecting them it is a must
   ii. Remember: we should be able to connect module over base and module over modules
4. Modules has a general architecture with the same size as the Base
   i. Since there are more than one moduel we have to consider general design and add minor changes to the design to fit to different modules
