# Enclosure

Since the PLUGSi consists of main components: Base and Modules, and considering modular architecture, the following decisions were made:

1. **Try to make it as small as possible**
   - Give it a compact futuristic look
2. **Uniformity in Design**
   - All sides in the Base and Modules are the same size and cubic shape
   - Must be able to connect modules over the base and modules over modules
3. **General Architecture**
   - Modules have a general architecture with the same size as the Base
   - Design must accommodate multiple modules with minor changes to fit different functionalities

The initial design is available on [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/plugsi-1). We were unable to complete the design due to imperfections of 3D printers and the inability to make a very compact design by hand. For the ports, it should be 4 pin ports. Initial ideas were to make ports and 3D print them (which was hard to do). So we thought about other options like [4-Pin magnetic POGO connections](https://kamami.pl/en/pogo-pin/1181255-pair-of-4-pin-magnetic-connectors-straight.html) and the [4-Pin magnetic POGO connections 3D models](https://grabcad.com/library/pogo-pins-ports-1). For the prototype, we used 4-Pin JST connections.

We have designed a prototype version of the PLUGSi enclosure which is done by laser cutting of acrylic.
